This project is in two parts, first with a single-column layout, and then as a two-column layout.

One-column Layout
-----------------

Beginning with the starter files, flesh out this blog homepage to look like the preview linked to below. I recommend starting with sketches or diagrams.

### Fashion Blog Alpha <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/fashion_blog_alpha.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/fashion_blog_alpha/))</small>

When you download the starter files, you'll notice that images are included along with a `reset.css` and a `normalize.css` if you'd like to use them. For help with these, I recommend taking a look at {% include link.html slug="images" %}, {% include link.html slug="css-placement" %}, and {% include link.html slug="reset-and-normalize" %}.

#### Design Notes

The red color for links is `#D00`. On hover, they turn to `#A00`. Bonus points if you can find a way to make them animated like they are in the preview.

The fonts used on the site are from [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts). Please read there to see how to set these up properly. It should be fairly straightforward. This site is using:

* Lato Light
* Lato Light Italic
* Lato Bold
* Lato Bold Italic

You should be able to build a collection and link to the appropriate fonts using only one line of code. (It should be a `<link>` tag.)

There are a slew of grays being used on the page, including (from lightest to darkest):

* `#EEE`
* `#DDD`
* `#CCC`
* `#BBB`
* `#444`
