Download [the starter files]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/cookie_recipe.zip) below and open them up in Sublime Text. (The easiest way by far will be to drag the entire folder, once unzipped, onto the Sublime Text app, which will give you access from the sidebar to all of the files in that folder.)

### Cookie Recipe <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/cookie_recipe.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/cookie_recipe/))</small>

The point of this project is to practice the basics of HTML markup, using the appropriate tags to mark up the various pieces of content on the page, which should result in a page the looks much like the [preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/cookie_recipe/) above.

Remember that the purpose of markup is simply to structure the content of the page. The look and feel will be taken care of separately by the CSS.

I recommend considering the following HTML elements as you work your way through this project:

* `p` - for paragraphs
* `a` - for links
* `img` - for images
* `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6` - for headings
* `ul`, `ol`, `li` - for lists
* `blockquote` - for blockquotes
* `br`, `hr` - for line breaks and sectioning rules
* `em`, `strong`, `small` - for emphasis and de-emphasis

You may not need all of these, but if you're getting lost I recommend looking any you aren't familiar with up using one of the references below.
