Computers will do what we tell them to do.


What is a Program?
------------------

A __program__ is a set of instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do


What is Programming?
--------------------

__Programming__ is the task of writing those instructions in a language that the computer can understand.


Becoming A Programmer
---------------------

It isn't about the programming language. It is about changing how you think.

We have to know how the computer thinks to change how we think.


How Computers 'Think'
---------------------

The short answer is that they don't think.

The slightly longer answer is that while computers donâ€™t think, they act as if they do, by sequentially executing simple instructions.

The only things a computer knows are the things we tell it.


Pseudo Code
-----------

Pseudocode is the process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language.

Pseudocode is a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs. For example,

	If the door is closed and I want to exit the room, then open the door

In this course we will learn what these keywords and structures are and how they are used to create a program...
