If you're interested in including a web font or two, I recommend looking into [Google's library of web fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) as a starting point. These have the advantage of being licensed for free web use, and are very easy to set up. Unfortunately, they are not the highest quality fonts (very much "you get what you pay for"), but there are some gems. Have a look at Chad Mozzola's [Beautiful Web Type](http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/) project for some of the nicer ones.

If you're interested, Matthew Butterick has a detailed discussion [on the open-source nature of Google's web font library](http://typographyforlawyers.com/why-google-web-fonts-arent-really-open-source.html).

I wouldn't recommend using these for class because they generally require registering a domain name in order to work (and cost money), but these are other web font services and providers worth looking into if you get the itch (in alphabetical order):

* [Cloud.typography](http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/)
* [Fontdeck](http://fontdeck.com)
* [Fonts.com Web Fonts](http://www.fonts.com/web-fonts)
* [Fontspring](http://www.fontspring.com)
* [Typecast](http://typecast.com)
* [Typekit](https://typekit.com)
* [Webfonts from Commercial Type](http://commercialtype.com/news/updates/webfonts_from_commercial_type)
* [Webtype](http://www.webtype.com)


Additional Reading
------------------

For an introduction regarding fonts as used on the screen, I'd recommend Jessica Hische's [Upping Your Type Game](http://jessicahische.is/talkingtype), which includes some excellent advice.

Jason Santa Maria also has a new book out on the topic, "[On Web Typography](http://www.abookapart.com/products/on-web-typography)", which takes a bit deeper dive.

Matthew Butterick can be a bit of a blowhard, but he has a wonderful book available online (for free), "[Butterick's Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com)". I'd especially recommend, as a starting point, [Typography in ten minutes](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html).
