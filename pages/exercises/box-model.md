This is a useful playground for developing a greater intuition for `background`, `margin`, `border`, and `padding`.

### Box Model <small>([on Codepen](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/jcqHa))</small>

The box model is a foundational thing to understand when it comes to how web pages work and what they can look like. Every element on the page is given such a box, which can be styled in various ways. All websites are essentially just boxes inside boxes inside boxes. A button is a box, a link is a box, a paragraph is a box, a nav is a box, a header is a box, etc.

Some other ways to affect how a box looks that you may want to play with include:

* `border-radius` - for rounded corners
* `box-shadow` - for drop-shadows and inner shadows

Have fun!
