Assignment
----------

Read Chapters 1 & 2 of [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html).

* Chapter 1: [Introduction](http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter1.html)
* Chapter 2: [Basic JavaScript: values, variables, and control flow](http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter2.html)

Don't worry if this doesn't all make total sense. The text is dense, so please focus more on familiarizing yourself with some of the concepts throughout. The work we do in class together will draw from the material covered especially in Chapter 2.
