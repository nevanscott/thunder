Assignment
----------

Make a good-faith effort to get started on the Startup Matchmaker project. We'll work on it together in class on Monday.


Details

### Startup Matchmaker <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/startup_matchmaker.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/startup_matchmaker/))</small>

Download the starter files, which will include the image(s) that you need. Use the preview as a reference. I do encourage you to refrain from peeking under the hood.

### Getting Started

My advice: start by drawing diagrams of the homepage, then proceed from the top of the page down.

### Fonts

The site is making use of the following [web fonts from Google](https://www.google.com/fonts):

- Source Sans Pro Normal
- Source Sans Pro Bold
- Oswald Bold
- Merriweather Bold
- Merriweather Bold Italic


Extra Practice
--------------

### Fashion Blog <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/fashion_blog.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/fashion_blog/))</small>

We won't have time for this in class, but if you are looking for more practice, I encourage you to work through this redesign of the fashion blog, which relies more heavily on floats than the original.
