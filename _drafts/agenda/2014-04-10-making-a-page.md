Agenda
------

* Box Model <small>(as a class)</small>
* Getting Started with the Fashion Blog <small>(as a class)</small>
* Fashion Blog Alpha <small>(in pairs)</small>


Starter Files
-------------

### Box Model <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/box_model.zip))</small>

We'll work as a class to explore `margin`, `border`, and `padding` a bit more.

### Fashion Blog Alpha <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/fashion_blog_alpha.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/fashion_blog_alpha/))</small>

Beginning with the starter files, flesh out this blog homepage to look like the preview linked to above. We'll discuss this first as a class.

#### Notes

The red color for links is `#D00`. On hover, they turn to `#A00`.

The fonts used on the site are from [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts). Please read there to see how to set these up properly. It should be fairly straightforward. This site is using:

* Lato Light
* Lato Light Italic
* Lato Bold
* Lato Bold Italic

There are a slew of grays being used on the page, including (from lightest to darkest):

* `#EEE`
* `#DDD`
* `#CCC`
* `#BBB`
* `#444`


Before Class
------------

Please look over the [MDN CSS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference), with a focus on these:

* `background`
* `border`
* `color`
* `display`
* `font-family`
* `font-size`
* `font-style`
* `font-weight`
* `line-height`
* `list-style`
* `margin`
* `padding`
* `text-align`
* `text-decoration`
* `text-indent`
* `text-transform`

For the Fashion Blog project, I'd also recommend looking at `:hover` and `:first-letter`.

Of course, if you feel like exploring more, please feel free.
