**Note:** I'm posting this in retrospect of yesterday's class.

Agenda
------

We explored more in-depth some of the CSS properties that we started to look at in the last class, and expand on them.


Notes
-----

* Many CSS properties can be written using a short-hand, such as `font`, `border`, and `background`.
* In general, I advise against using the `font` shorthand as it can be quite confusing.


### Backgrounds in CSS

We made use of various longhand `background` properties in class, including `background-color`, `background-image`, `background-repeat`, and `background-position`.

Keep in mind that with `background-position` in particular, things may not work exactly as our intuitions may guide us.

For examples, try the following `background-position` settings on an example of your own devising:

```css
background-position: top left;
background-position: center center;
background-position: 20px 50px;
background-position: 25% 25%;
background-position: 100% 100%;
background-position: 50% 50%;
```

These will all work best if used in conjunction with `background-repeat: no-repeat;`, so that only one background image is placed.
