## Agenda

* Web Development WTF?
* Sublime Text
* Basic HTML
* Lab

Today's class is primarily about getting situated and setting the stage for the course ahead of us. We will get to know each other better so that we can all feel more comfortable helping each other out and asking questions throughout the class. Every good developer I know got good in the same way: lots of practice, and having a strong peer group that they could bat ideas around with.

In this class, we're at an advantage: we have a built-in group of peers. Everyone will be coming in with different experiences, which means everyone will have a unique perspective to bring to the table. Let's press our advantage by working together.

## Starter Files

For most classes, we'll have some files to get you started on work we might do together, in groups or pairs, or individually as labs. For today, here are the first installments:

### GA Press Release <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/ga_press_release.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/ga_press_release/))</small>

### Cookie Recipe <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/cookie_recipe.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/cookie_recipe/))</small>

We'll discuss what to do with these in class. For now don't sweat it.

## Before Class

Make sure you have downloaded a copy of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). You'll want version 2.0. This is the text editor we'll all be using in class, just so we're on the same page. There are a lot of great text editors out there.

Also, if you haven't already, please install [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/). Same reasoning: we all want to be using the same tools in class. If you have a different preferred browser, totally cool.
