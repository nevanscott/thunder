Starter Files

### Fashion Blog <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/fashion_blog.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/fashion_blog/))</small>

2-column redesign of "Sartre's List".

### Startup Matchmaker <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/startup_matchmaker.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/startup_matchmaker/))</small>

A new marketing website for an imaginary startup.

We'll start off both of these projects by drawing diagrams together so that we have a schematic to follow as we build.
