* Traffic Light with jQuery
* Color Switcher with jQuery
* FAQ Page


Starter Files
-------------

### Traffic Light with jQuery <small>([on Codepen](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/cyDHr))</small>

We'll look at this again to see a bit about how jQuery works.

### Color Scheme Switcher with jQuery <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/color_scheme_switcher.zip))</small>

Using the jQuery library, we'll redo Color Scheme Switcher yet again.


Further Reading
---------------

Please take some time to start looking at the [jQuery documentation](http://api.jquery.com). Oscar Otero also has a really nice table of contents for the docs at his [jQuery Cheatsheet](http://oscarotero.com/jquery/).

jQuery allows us to manipulate the page using a much simpler syntax than what we've been using so far.

For example, we've been writing something like:

```js
document.getElementById('thingy').onclick = doSomething;

function doSomething() {
	// make something happen here
}
```

In jQuery, this might look more like:

```js
$('#thingy').click(doSomething);

function doSomething() {
	// make something happen here
}
```

We will certainly be discussing this in more detail, but in general jQuery lets us grab some element from the page (`$('#thingy')`), and do something with it (`$('#thingy').click(doSomething);`). In this case, we grabbed an element with the id `thingy` and used `.click()` to make a function run when the user clicks on `#thingy`.

For now, as you start to get used to this idea, I'd like you to look through the documentation above, and have a look at some of these things we can do to an element (or elements) using jQuery:

* `.toggleClass()` -- turn a given class off or on
* `.hasClass()` -- check if the element has a given class
* `.hide()` -- visually hide the element
* `.show()` -- visually show the element
* `.slideUp()` -- animate to hide the element
* `.slideDown()` -- animate to show the element
* `.siblings()` -- find the element's siblings
* `.removeClass()` -- remove a given class from the element
* `.addClass()` -- add a given class to the element
